This Android Application is made for indoor navigation within the college peripherals as the various departments of the college are interconnected to each other. It becomes difficult for any student to search for a particular lab or class, so this application will provide them with the navigation to that particular place from his current location. 
In this application, the user will be able to see his current location in the MapView, then he can search for the location where he wants to go, and then a button will popup for directions/navigations. Then it will ask the user to select a point from a bunch of points near to his current position, and then after selecting that point the application will show the user the path from his current location to the desired location. If the path is between the departments, then it will show the indoor map of the department for easy navigation.
